# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

    `wpm` is an integer representing the number
    of words the user can read per minute
    `minutes` is an integer representing the
    number of minutes the user has to read
    Returns a string with a chunk of the contents that the user could read
    in the given number of minutes.
    If called again, `reading_chunk` should return the next chunk, skipping
    what has already been read, until the contents is fully read.
    The next call after that it should restart from the beginning.

## 2. Design the Method Signature
```ruby
def reading_chunk(wpm, minutes) -> string

# EXAMPLE

# `extract_upper` extracts uppercase words from a list of words
truncated_words = reading_chunk(200, 10)

# The method doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

reading_chunk(5, 1) -> 5 words
reading_chunk(4, 2) -> 8 words
reading_chunk() -> 
reading_chunk()

extract_uppercase("hello WoRLD") => []
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD!") => ["WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("") => []
extract_uppercase(nil) throws an error
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
